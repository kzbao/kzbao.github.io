        <p>
          My business partner and I have collectively worked at companies such as Facebook, Microsoft, Google, and Spotify.
          We were at these companies during interesting periods, e.g. Facebook pre-IPO, Spotify during IPO, and consequently have a unique perspective on the evolution of tech companies and their hiring practices.
          We've spent time in software engineering and product management roles, but also more recently in hiring manager roles.
          We understand the ins and outs of hiring in our industry so we can help you position your career in the way that you want.
