        <h1>Manager Readme</h1>

        <p>
          This is my Manager Readme, a document that helps introduce to you my management style, beliefs, and expectations.
          Honestly, you'd figure this all out within your first month, but since there's so much other stuff being thrown at you from all directions when you start, I hope this provides a helpful overview and some basic guidelines.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h2>My Job</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>Ensure you are unblocked and capable of doing your best work</li>
          <li>Ensure the team is making progress when it comes to both building product and internal culture</li>
          <li>Ensure things are running smoothly across the company</li>
          <li>Write code</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          The points above are deliberately ordered because that's how I typically prioritize my day to day.
          Because I'm measured by our team's ability to deliver value to the business, it's in my interest to ensure that you and the rest of the team are set up to succeed.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h2>To Micromanage or Not</h2>

        <p>
          In terms of being hands on or hands off as a manager: it depends.
          Yes, that's kind of a stereotypical managerial approach at this point, but I will ask you regularly during our 1:1's how to adjust to your needs.
          I believe everyone should take a high degree of individual responsibility for their own success and the success of those around them.
          I'd go with that as a starting point and would prefer not to micromanage if it's unnecessary.
          However, if you feel uncertain about things or want extra guidance, I'm more than happy to provide help in ways that would be most effective for you.
          I will adapt to what works best for you.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h2>On Communication</h2>

        <p>
          Efficient outcomes (from a game theory perspective) are more likely to happen as participants have more information about the circumstances.
          At work, communication is what allows us to gain and share this information.
          It's always better to overcommunicate than undercommunicate. Repetition works, and whatever is obvious to you may not be to others.
          It's really important to assume that everyone has good intent at the core, that everyone wants our company to succeed.
          We all tend to value transparency, but for an organization to be transparent, it requires a conscious effort from everyone to communicate knowledge and information.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>On Work/Life Balance</h2>

        <p>
          As long as it's not problematic, I don't care too much about your exact working hours.
          I can be a night owl at times, so I completely understand.
          However, I do expect that you're available to respond to anything during normal business hours (9 to 5 on weekdays), otherwise you could be blocking others.
          Outside of these hours, there's no expectation to respond unless it's an emergency.
        </p>

        <p>
          There will be times when the workload can get heavy, especially when we're trying to grow quickly.
          As a team, we'll prioritize delivering on schedule but try to do so with a reasonable plan.
          If this is making you unhappy or stressing you out, please let me know.
        </p>

        <h2>Kevin <> You 1:1</h2>

        <p>
          I will put time on the calendar for weekly 1-on-1's with you.
          This will likely be 30 minutes a week to start, but if you want more time, we can adjust.
          Feel free to put time on my calendar if you need it.
        </p>

        <p>
          1:1's are your time to talk to me about anything and everything you want.
          I will probably have some points to discuss with you, but I would encourage you to drive the conversation around what matters to you.
          This is your opportunity to share anything you want with me outside of a group setting.
        </p>

        <p>
          I will try to give you negative feedback regularly as part of 1:1's. Please don't take this personally but understand that we all have opportunities to improve, myself included.
          If there's feedback you want to give to me, I prefer blunt and honest communication.
          I'd much rather hear "Kevin, you're doing a bad job" than let that sentiment build up without the opportunity to correct it.
        </p>

        <h2>Some Principles</h2>

        <p>These are general principles that I find useful at work and in life. Not listed in any particular order.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Every failure is a learning opportunity. Embrace failure but balance it with successes (you can fail but don't only fail).</li>
          <li>No individual comes before the team. This is crucial in every work environment, otherwise you wouldn't be part of a company.</li>
          <li>There are no dumb questions. Don't be afraid to ask any question but try to answer it for yourself in a timeboxed manner beforehand.</li>
          <li>Be on the lookout for opportunities to kill two birds with one stone. These are often the best initiatives to go after because you are both productive and efficient.</li>
        </ul>
