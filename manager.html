        <h1>Manager Readme</h1>

        <p>
          This is my Manager Readme, a document that helps introduce to you my management style, philosophies, and expectations.
          Honestly, you'd figure this all out within your first month, but since there's so much other stuff being fired at you from all directions when you start, I hope this provides a helpful overview and guidelines.

        <h2>My job</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>Make sure you are happy</li>
          <li>Make sure our team is making progress</li>
          <li>Ensure things are running smoothly across the company</li>
          <li>Write code</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          The points above are deliberately ordered because that's how I typically prioritize my day to day.
          Because I'm measured by our team's ability to deliver value to the business, it's in my interest to ensure that you and the rest of the team are set up to succeed.

        <h2>My Values</h2>

        <p>
          When it comes to making decisions, I tend to favor arriving at pragmatic path forward and I prioritize on delivering to our end users. To illustrate this, consider that our codebase has 95% test coverage. While I would certainly prefer tests to be written in all cases, if we are approaching a deadline then meeting the deadline is more important to me than writing the tests. I believe oftware engineering is all about tradeoffs, so in the absence of achieving the ideal, we have to make quick and reasonable decisions. Code can always be rewritten. That being said, read on :)
        </p>

        <p>
          I expect everyone to try to be as detailed and as rigorous as possible with their work.
          The keyword there is <i>try</i>; things don't always go as planned, but I believe we should proactively do everything we can to ensure quality and success.
          This includes end to end ownership of what you ship.
          That means for any project you're working on, hold yourself accountable for its design, implementation, release, maintenance, and planning of subsequent iteration.
          Hopefully, this allows you to grow as a leader and our team to effectively ship with quality all the time.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe the vast majority of issues that come up during work are related to communication.
          It's extremely important that we communicate well across the team and the company.
          We all tend to value transparency, but for an organization to be transparent, it requires a conscious effort from everyone to communicate knowledge and information.
          Ultimately, you can't control what any other person does but you can control what you do, so instead of wasting energy complaining or blaming, why not channel that into something more productive, i.e. your own work?
          Always ask yourself what you, not someone else, can do better.

        <p>Out of Karat's Leadership Principles, the following resonate most strongly with me.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Solve the client problem</li>
          <li>Create the future</li>
          <li>Learn quickly</li>
          <li>Own it</li>
        </ul>
      <div>
        <h2>Kevin <> You 1:1</h2>

        <p>
          I will put time on the calendar for weekly 1-on-1's with you.
          This will likely be 30 minutes a week to start, but if you want more or less time, we can adjust.
          Feel free to put time on my calendar if you need it.
        </p>

        <p>
          1:1's are your time to talk to me about anything and everything you want.
          I will probably have some points to discuss with you, but I would encourage you to drive the conversation around what matters to you.
          This is your opportunity to share anything you want with me outside of a group setting.
          If there's feedback you want to give to me, I prefer blunt and honest communication.
          I'd much rather hear "Kevin, you're doing a bad job" than let that sentiment build up without the opportunity to correct it.
          I don't mind giving blunt feedback to you either, but I know this doesn't work for everyone, so I will adapt to your style.
          Let me know what works best for you!

        <h2>Work/Life Balance</h2>

        <p>
          As long as it's not problematic, I don't care too much about your exact working hours.
          I can be a night owl at times, so I completely understand.
          However, I do expect that you're available to respond to anything during normal business hours (9 to 5 on weekdays), otherwise you could be blocking others.
          Outside of these hours, there's no expectation to respond unless it's an emergency.
        </p>

        <p>
          Given that we're a startup, there will be times when the workload gets heavy and the hours get crazy.
          As a team, we'll prioritize delivering on schedule but try to do so reasonably.
          If this is making you unhappy or stressing you out, please let me know.
