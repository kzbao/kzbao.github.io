        <p>Here are some books and publications that I've found interesting and useful.</p>

        <h2>Nonfiction Books</h2>

        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Networks-Crowds-Markets-Reasoning-Connected/dp/0521195330">Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning about a Highly Connected World</a> &mdash; Economics meets computer science. This book includes a good number of topics at the forefront of these fields and relates them to our world. It is mathematically rigorous so it can be a dry read, but I find the topics covered extremely fascinating.</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Who-Gets-What-Why-Matchmaking/dp/0544705289">Who Gets What â€• and Why: The New Economics of Matchmaking and Market Design</a> &mdash; Market design is a relatively new topic within economics that attempts to formalize markets and the underlying forces that shape them. This is a good introduction to that written by a Nobel Prize winner.</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Predictably-Irrational-Hidden-Forces-Decisions/dp/B0014EAHNQ">Predictably Irrational</a> &mdash; A fun read that illustrates how humans can be quite irrational sometimes but in the most predictable of ways.</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0062316117">Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</a> &mdash; Self-explanatory from the title, this is an interesting read for anyone who wonders how we got here as a species.</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Hackers-Geniuses-Created-Revolution/dp/1476708703">The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution</a> &mdash; A wonderful survey of the computer age and the people who made it happen.</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove/dp/0679762884">High Output Management</a> &mdash; The best summary of good management principles I've read to date.</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QYCHJ7V">An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management</a> &mdash; One of my mentors used to remark that most engineers don't enter industry to become managers so resources on becoming one are scarce. This has been the best read on engineering management specifically.</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Options-as-Strategic-Investment-Fifth/dp/0735204659">Options as a Strategic Investment</a> &mdash; Trading options is almost a second job of mine at times and this book is an amazing resource on a variety of strategies that can be applied in all kinds of market conditions. My thesis is that certain market inefficiencies exist in the options market in a predictably irrational way.</li>
        </ul>
