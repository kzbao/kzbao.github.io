        <p>
          I'm a problem solver, aspiring entrepreneur, and avid paraglider.
          I currently live in Seattle, though I grew up mostly in HoCo Maryland and root for Boston sports teams.

          I'm interested in technology -- it's what I deal with day-to-day as the <a href="manager">engineering manager</a> at <a href="https://karat.io">Karat^</a> and it's a fascinating lens through which we can view the development of humankind.
          In my spare time, I enjoy being outdoors, speculating in the stock market, and fresh tuna (nothing beats a nice cut of otoro).
          In the winter, you'll find me sending it on the ski slopes and in the summer, I'm either flying around in my Nova Ion or backpacking mountains.
          Music is also a big part of my life.
          I primarily play piano, flute, and guitar.
          Let's jam sometime?
