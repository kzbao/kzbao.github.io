        <p>
          I'm a problem solver, engineering leader, and professional adventurer.
          I currently live in Bellevue, Washington, though I grew up mostly in Ellicott City, Maryland and root for New England sports teams (thanks to being born in Rhode Island).
          I attended Carnegie Mellon University and graduated at age 20 with dual degrees in computer science and economics.
        </p>

        <p>
          I started my engineering career at age 18 as an intern at Facebook. There, I worked on the first version of Timeline and learned about ambitions of a company on the verge of IPO-ing.
          After that, I worked on Windows user experience at Microsoft. One of my key contributions was putting ads in the Windows 10 start menu, which was a real mood killer. Nonetheless, as a result, I have experience building product across the full stack from OS kernel to making things look nice in web browsers.
          Today, I am an <a href="manager">engineering leader</a> at <a href="https://karat.com">Karat^</a>, where I joined as employee #8. I currently lead our client engineering team and have worn many hats from writing code to inventing business jargon.
          More broadly speaking, I'm passionate about the intersection of new technology and business and I'm curious about the science behind our universe.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my spare time, I enjoy being outdoors, playing music, and finding good food to eat.
          In the winter, I try to spend nearly every weekend on the ski slopes and in the summer, you'll find me flying around on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsnSWWotWR0">paraglider</a> or sport climbing at Exit 38.
          Music is a huge part of my life. If I'm not listening to something, I'm probably playing. Piano, flute, and guitar are my main instruments though I love to dabble and experiment with all kinds of sounds. I have perfect pitch so name any song and let's jam!
