        <p>
          I'm a problem solver, engineering leader, and professional adventurer.
          I currently live in Bellevue, Washington, though I grew up mostly in Ellicott City, Maryland and root for Boston sports teams (I'm not a fairweather fan, I was born in Rhode Island).
          I attended Carnegie Mellon University and graduated in 2013 at age 20 with dual degrees in computer science and economics.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm passionate about intersection of technology, business, and art.
          The former two are what I deal with day-to-day as the <a href="manager">engineering leader</a> at <a href="https://karat.com">Karat^</a>, where I joined as employee #8.
          Before this, I worked on Windows user experience at Microsoft. My peak contribution was putting ads in the Windows 10 start menu, which damped my interest in furthering Windows. Before that, I worked on the first version of Timeline at Facebook as an intern when I was 18. As a result, I have experience shipping projects across the full stack from OS kernel to making things look nice in web browsers.
          I also spent time in Disney Imagineering and TA-ed computer science and economics classes during university.
          I'm driven to pursue opportunities and create businesses in anticipation of future trends.
          In doing so, I believe it's important to balance pragmatism with ethics.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my spare time, I enjoy being outdoors, playing music, and finding good food to eat.
          In the winter, I'm probably sending it on the ski slopes and in the summer, you'll find me flying around on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsnSWWotWR0">paraglider</a> or planning out a backpacking trip.
          Music is a huge part of my life. If I'm not listening to something, I'm probably playing. Piano, flute, and guitar are my main instruments though I love to dabble and experiment with all kinds of sounds. I have perfect pitch so name any song and let's jam!
