        <p>
          I'm a problem solver, aspiring entrepreneur, and professional adventurer.
          I currently live in Seattle, Washington, though I grew up mostly in Ellicott City, Maryland and root for Boston sports teams (I was born in Rhode Island).
          I attended Carnegie Mellon University and graduated in 2013 with degrees in computer science and economics.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm passionate about intersection of technology, business, and art.
          The former two are what I deal with day-to-day as the <a href="manager">engineering manager</a> at <a href="https://karat.com">Karat^</a>.
          Before this, I worked on Windows user experience at Microsoft, and even before that, I worked on the first version of Timeline at Facebook, so I have experience across the full stack from OS kernel to making things look nice in web browsers.
          I also spent some time in Disney Imagineering and TA-ed computer science and economics classes at Carnegie Mellon.
          I'm driven to pursue opportunities and create businesses in anticipation of future trends.
          In doing so, I believe it's important to balance pragmatism with ethics.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my spare time, I enjoy being outdoors, playing music, and finding good food to eat.
          In the winter, I'm probably sending it on the ski slopes and in the summer, you'll find me flying around on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsnSWWotWR0">paraglider</a>.
          Music is also a big part of my life; I mostly play piano, flute, and guitar. I have perfect pitch so name a song and let's jam!
