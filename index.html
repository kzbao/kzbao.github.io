        <h1>Hi, I'm Kevin Bao.</h1>

        <p>
          I'm a problem solver, aspiring entrepreneur, and avid paraglider.
          I currently live in Seattle, Washington, though I grew up mostly in Ellicott City, Maryland and root for Boston sports teams.
        </p>

        <p>
          My passion lies at the intersection of software engineering and business.
          It's what I deal with day-to-day as the <a href="manager">engineering manager</a> at <a href="https://karat.io">Karat^</a>.
          I'm driven to pursue opportunities and create businesses in anticipation of future trends.
          In doing so, I believe it's important to balance pragmatism with ethics.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my spare time, I enjoy being outdoors, playing music, and fresh tuna (nothing beats a nice cut of otoro).
          In the winter, I'm probably sending it on the ski slopes and in the summer, you'll find me flying around on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsnSWWotWR0">paraglider</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Music is also a big part of my life; I primarily play piano, flute, and guitar.
          Always down to jam!
