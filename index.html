          I'm a problem solver, engineering leader, and professional adventurer.
          I currently live in Bellevue, Washington, though I grew up mostly in Ellicott City, Maryland and root for New England sports teams (thanks to being born in Rhode Island).
          I attended Carnegie Mellon University and graduated at age 20 with dual degrees in computer science and economics.

          I started my software engineering career as an intern at Facebook. I interviewed as a freshman expecting to only practice for future internships but the interview problems were similar to the kind I had solved at math or programming competitions. During that summer, I worked on the first version of Timeline and was part of a hypergrowth company on the verge of IPO-ing. I witnessed how a technology company made bets that would shape our world in the years that followed.
          A year later, I started working on Windows user experience at Microsoft. My projects included the first run experience, the retail demo experience, and putting ads in Windows as part of a transition to a free Windows model. This provided me experience building product across the full stack from OS kernel to making things look nice in web browsers.
          Today, I am an <a href="manager">engineering leader</a> at <a href="https://karat.com">Karat^</a>, where I joined as employee #8. I've worn many hats in the past five years, from writing code to inventing all kinds of business jargon. I currently lead our client engineering team, responsible for all things client.
          More broadly speaking, I'm passionate about the intersection of new technology and business and I'm curious about the science behind our universe.

          In my spare time, I enjoy being outdoors, playing music, and finding good food to eat.
          In the winter, I try to spend nearly every weekend on the ski slopes and in the summer, you'll find me flying around on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsnSWWotWR0">paraglider</a> or sport climbing at Exit 38.
          Music is a huge part of my life. If I'm not listening to something, I'm probably playing. Piano, flute, and guitar are my main instruments though I love to dabble and experiment with all kinds of sounds. I have perfect pitch so name any song and let's jam!
