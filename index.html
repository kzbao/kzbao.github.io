        <p>I'm a problem solver, aspiring entrepreneur, and avid paraglider currently living in Seattle. I'm interested in technology -- it's what I deal with day-to-day as the <a href="manager">engineering manager</a> at <a href="https://karat.io">Karat^</a> and it's a fascinating lens through which we can view the development of economies and humankind.</p>

        <p>In my spare time, I enjoy being outdoors, speculating in the stock market, and fresh tuna. In the winter, you'll find me on the ski slopes and in the summer, I'm either flying around or backpacking mountains. I grew up mostly in Maryland (Hoco for you Marylanders), but I'm a diehard Boston sports fan.</p>
