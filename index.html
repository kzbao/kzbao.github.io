      <p>Welcome to Kevin Bao's personal website.</p>

      <p>I'm a software engineer and aspiring entrepreneur located in the greater Seattle area. My interests lie in computer systems, mathematics, and economic theory. I find <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design">market design</a> particularly fascinating as I believe it offers a framework for solving many of today's economic problems.</p>

      <p>In my spare time, I enjoy paragliding, photography, speculating in the stock market, and all things music. I grew up on the East coast, mostly in Maryland, but I'm a diehard Patriots and Red Sox fan.</p>

      <p>I am currently a software engineer at <a href="https://karat.io/">Karat^</a>.</p>
